We’re deploying AI to dismantle project narratives and surfacing the “Truth Gap” in capital programs. But as the signal gets louder, so does the noise.</p><p>I’ve realized something: I’m not good at weeding. I’ve never had to be. But if you don’t clear the field, the parasites will choke the engine.</p><p>I’ve identified three types of “Industry Weeds” that every high-growth founder needs to recognize and delete immediately.</p><h3>1. The Rent-Seeker (The “Taxman”)</h3><p>This is the person who sees your Ferrari and tries to sell you a “speed limit” sticker. I recently dealt with a veteran who wanted to “collaborate.” The moment he saw the power of the tech, he tried to pivot from a guest judge to a licensing partner. He wanted to “tax” my innovation with trailing royalties for his “governance notes.”</p><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> If they want to be in the driver’s seat of a car they didn’t build, they aren’t a partner—they’re a hitchhiker looking for a payday.</p><h3>2. The Ghost (The “Amateur”)</h3><p>I had a commissioning lead reach out. “Let’s sync, huge alignment, I want to see the protocol.” We set the time. Show time comes. Nothing. No email, no cancellation, no “something came up.” Just a blank Zoom room.</p><p>In this industry, your word is your bond, and your calendar is your reputation. If you can’t manage a 20-minute calendar invite, you sure as hell can’t manage a $100M project recovery.</p><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Ghosting isn’t just a lack of manners; it’s a lack of rigor. It’s an immediate, permanent disqualification.</p><h3>3. The Brain-Picker (The “Vampire”)</h3><p>Then there’s the ex-Big Four consultant. “I’d love to meet to pick your brain.”</p><p>Think about that phrase. It’s purely extractive. They want to download $50,000 worth of IP and 20 years of “Forensic Scars” over a cup of coffee (that they probably won’t even pay for). I gave one the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe there was a network play. I sent the link. Result? Total silence.</p><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> I am not a public library. My “brain” is the R&amp;D department of a high-value firm. If you want access to it, you either bring a checkbook or an equivalent exchange of value.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The New Standard: Pre-Qualification or GTFO</h3><p>I’ve learned my lesson. My calendar is no longer an open door—it’s a secure vault.</p><p>From here on out, we are moving to <strong>Instrument Flight Rules.</strong> If you want a piece of the Sentient roadmap, you have to prove you belong in the room.</p><ol><li><p><strong>No “Brain Picking”:</strong> If you don’t have a specific problem to solve or a specific value to offer, the answer is “Read the Substack.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Mandatory Pre-Qualification:</strong> If you want a slot, you’ll be filling out a diagnostic first. If the logic doesn’t hold water, the link doesn’t get sent.</p></li><li><p><strong>The “Theater” Test:</strong> If you’re more interested in the “narrative” of innovation than the “physics” of the work, stay in the cheap seats.</p></li></ol><p>I’m built for the 60-day sprint. I don’t have time to teach “Introduction to Integrity” to people who are just looking for a hustle or a free lunch.</p><p>The “Sentient” model isn’t just about auditing projects; it’s about auditing the people we let into the ecosystem. The weeds are being cleared.</p><p>Let’s get back to the physics.</p>
