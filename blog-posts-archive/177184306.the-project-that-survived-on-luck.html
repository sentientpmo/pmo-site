The project that, by all logical measures, should have failed. For me, that project was Risk Reporting &amp; Integrations 2025, and for the longest time, I’ve told myself we just got lucky.</p><p>Looking back, I realize it was something more.</p><p>It was early March, and I was already juggling a full portfolio, including a high-stakes CyberArk implementation and a complex Active Directory project. Then, I was handed RRI25. The circumstances were unusual, and I walked into the first technical meeting on Day 2 with more questions than answers.</p><p>Within 45 minutes, the project’s neat and tidy schedule was in flames. We were hit with a perfect storm:</p><ul><li><p>Our single most critical Subject Matter Expert was unexpectedly out on a medical emergency.</p></li><li><p>We confirmed there was no test environment for a core system—all work had to be done in Production.</p></li><li><p>A non-negotiable security mandate from a key stakeholder invalidated our entire technical plan.</p></li><li><p>We uncovered a hidden compliance minefield of regulated data that put hard boundaries on what we could build.</p></li></ul><p>I remember thinking, “How do we possibly survive this?” The project had every classic ingredient for failure, and we were only 48 hours in. The logical assessment was clear: this project should have derailed.</p><p>We delivered it successfully. And for months, my go-to explanation has been, “Boy, were we lucky.”</p><p>But as I’ve reflected on that project—I’ve started to see that “luck” was actually a series of deliberate choices made by a team under incredible pressure. What felt like dodging bullets was, in reality, a masterclass in crisis navigation that I was too deep in the storm to recognize at the time.</p><p><strong>Where “Luck” Was Actually Skill in Disguise</strong></p><p>It’s hard to judge your own actions in the heat of the moment. You’re just trying to keep things moving. But looking back, I can see the critical pivots the team made that had nothing to do with luck.</p><p><strong>1. We felt “lucky” that the security mandate didn’t kill the project.</strong><br>In reality, the team didn’t get lucky; we got pragmatic. When the platform team mandated OAuth 2.0 and we discovered the target system couldn’t support it, we didn’t give up. We investigated, found a viable and secure alternative (API Keys), and negotiated a compromise. We respected the stakeholder’s intent while providing a realistic path forward. That wasn’t luck; <strong>that was data-driven negotiation.</strong></p><p><strong>2. We felt “lucky” that our key SME returned.</strong><br>While his return was crucial, the team didn’t just wait passively. We immediately activated our backup SME. We kept the project moving on the questions we <em>could</em> answer and meticulously documented the ones we couldn’t. We built a plan that could function in the SME’s absence, making his return an accelerator, not a prerequisite for survival. That wasn’t luck; <strong>that was resilient resource management.</strong></p><p><strong>3. We felt “lucky” that we didn’t break the production environment.</strong><br>The risk of working in a production-only system was enormous. But the team didn’t just cross their fingers. We confronted the risk head-on, secured formal acceptance from the business owners, and collaboratively designed a safe testing protocol. We created guardrails where none existed. That wasn’t luck; <strong>that was proactive risk mitigation.</strong></p><p><strong>The Real Definition of a “Lucky” Project</strong></p><p>I still believe there’s an element of luck in any successful project. You can’t control everything. But RRI25 taught me a profound lesson.</p><p>A project isn’t “lucky” because it avoids problems. A project is “lucky” when it has a team with the courage to face those problems head-on. It’s “lucky” when it has leaders who can create clarity from chaos, and stakeholders who are willing to engage in pragmatic problem-solving.</p><p>It’s not all about one person. It was the collective effort: the platform owner who held a firm line on security, the technical lead who investigated the impossible mandate, and the business owners who formally accepted the environmental risks.</p><p>I may have been the one steering the ship, but the entire crew was bailing water, patching holes, and helping me read the compass.</p><p>So yes, I still think we were lucky. We were lucky to have a team that, when faced with every reason to fail, chose to lead instead. And that, I’ve learned, is the kind of luck you have to make for yourself.</p>
