A colleague leans in, lowers their voice, and asks, "Have you tried using AI for meeting minutes?"</p><p>The answer is an emphatic "yes," followed by a story of how it's a game-changer, a productivity unlock, a way to finally escape the administrative grind.</p><p>And it's all true. Using an AI to transcribe and summarize your meetings is the new table stakes for any serious program manager. It's a fantastic first step.</p><p>But it’s just that—a first step.</p><p>The common refrain I hear next is, "Of course, it's not perfect. You have to proofread it. It gets the names wrong sometimes." We treat these flaws as an acceptable cost of convenience.</p><p>I believe that's the wrong way to look at it. The AI's mistakes aren't a flaw in the technology; they're a flaw in our method. We are treating a powerful intelligence like a simple transcriber. We are giving it a task without giving it a briefing.</p><p>When you onboard a new junior project manager, you don't just hand them a recording and say, "Tell me what happened." You give them the project charter and the stakeholder list. You brief them so they can understand not just <em>what</em> was said, but <em>why it matters.</em></p><p>We must do the same for our AI co-pilots.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Level 1: The Briefing Dossier - Eliminating "Contextual Amnesia"</strong></h3><p>For my most complex programs, I’ve stopped just dropping a transcript into a prompt window. I now provide a comprehensive <strong>"Briefing Dossier"</strong> along with the transcript. It transforms the AI from a passive listener into a knowledgeable participant for a single event.</p><p>Here is the three-part dossier that gets me near-perfect summaries every time.</p><p><strong>1. The "Ground Truth" Snapshot (The Roster):</strong><br>The easiest way to fix the "wrong names" problem is to prevent it. My hack: I take a screenshot of the MS Teams or Zoom invitation. This image contains the critical metadata: the exact meeting title, date, and attendee list. I feed this to the AI first. <em>Boom.</em> The AI has its official roster.</p><p><strong>2. The Project Context (The "One-Pager"):</strong><br>Next, I provide a "one-pager" on the project's soul. What is the objective? What are the key workstreams? What are the primary risks? This tells the AI what to listen <em>for</em>. For example, on "Project Apex," the AI is briefed that any mention of "API rate limiting" is a high-risk item to be flagged.</p><p><strong>3. The Project Lexicon (The "Jargon Buster"):</strong><br>Every team has its own shorthand. I provide a glossary of our common acronyms and terms (e.g., <em>DWH, ETL, UAT, SteerCo</em>). This eliminates 90% of transcription errors and makes the final summary instantly readable.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Level 2: The Context Package - Giving Your AI a Memory</strong></h3><p>The Briefing Dossier is fantastic for getting a perfect summary of a single meeting. But its knowledge is isolated. It suffers from <strong>"Contextual Amnesia,"</strong> with no memory of what was decided on Monday when it's summarizing Tuesday's call.</p><p>The real breakthrough happens when you stop giving your AI a briefing and start giving it a <strong>memory.</strong></p><p>Before I ask my AI to summarize a critical meeting, I now provide it with a curated <strong>"Context Package"</strong>—a collection of recent, relevant project artifacts. Depending on the meeting, this might include:</p><ul><li><p>The entire <strong>RAID Log</strong> as a text file.</p></li><li><p>The executive summaries from the <strong>last three weekly meetings.</strong></p></li><li><p>The <strong>last two status reports</strong> sent to the Steering Committee.</p></li></ul><p>I feed the AI this package along with the new meeting transcript. The prompt is no longer just "summarize this." It's "summarize this new transcript <em>in the context of these recent events</em>."</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>From Summary to True Synthesis</strong></h3><p>This is where the magic happens. The AI is no longer just a scribe. It becomes a junior analyst. It can now <strong>connect the dots across time.</strong></p><p>When you provide the full <strong>Dossier (Snapshot + Context + Lexicon)</strong> and the <strong>Context Package (RAID Log, past summaries)</strong>, the AI's output is no longer a mere summary. It’s a work of true synthesis.</p><ul><li><p>It doesn't just note a new action item; it can flag that this <strong>action item contradicts a decision made last week.</strong></p></li><li><p>It doesn't just summarize a discussion about a technical issue; it can cross-reference it with the RAID log and ask, <strong>"Is this related to Risk #117?"</strong></p></li><li><p>It doesn't just capture a new timeline commitment; it can compare it to the last status report and highlight, <strong>"This represents a 2-week slip from the previously communicated date."</strong></p></li></ul><p>The future of work isn't just about using AI. It's about learning how to collaborate with it. Our most valuable new skill is <strong>context curation</strong>—knowing which documents to provide to give our AI the memory it needs to generate the deepest insights. We are moving past simple automation and building a true partnership with an intelligence that can remember, correlate, and reason across the entire lifecycle of our projects.</p>
