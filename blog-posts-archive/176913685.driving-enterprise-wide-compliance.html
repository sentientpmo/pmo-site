Recently, I led a strategic initiative to modernize the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) capabilities for a major energy provider responsible for critical national infrastructure. The goal was clear: establish a modern, enterprise-wide capability for risk management and operationalize the new NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.</p><p>This wasn’t a simple software deployment. It was a complex program with three core challenges that will be familiar to anyone leading transformations in a regulated, enterprise environment.</p><p>Here’s a look at our playbook for navigating them.</p><h4><strong>The Challenge 1: Bridging the Old and the New with a Legacy System</strong></h4><p>Our modern ServiceNow IRM platform needed to communicate with a deeply embedded, legacy change management system (ChangeGear). This system was critical to operations but lacked modern API capabilities.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> The primary obstacle was technical and security-related. We had to architect a custom integration that could automate ticket creation from ServiceNow and return the ticket number, but the legacy system’s outdated authentication methods created significant risk and required deep collaboration with architecture, cybersecurity, and the platform teams to find a viable path forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Playbook:</strong> Instead of forcing a solution, we embraced a <strong>collaborative, risk-based approach</strong>. We initiated a dedicated technical workstream focused solely on resolving this blocker. By facilitating direct communication between cybersecurity architects and the legacy system’s SMEs, we methodically evaluated all potential authentication methods, ultimately designing a solution that met security standards without requiring an expensive, time-consuming upgrade of the legacy tool.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>The Challenge 2: Operationalizing a New Regulatory Standard</strong></h4><p>Implementing the NIST CSF 2.0 framework is more than a box-checking exercise. It requires building a sustainable, user-friendly process for control attestations, reporting, and scoring that business stakeholders will actually adopt.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> We needed to translate the dense framework into an intuitive workflow within ServiceNow. The process had to be robust enough for auditors but simple enough for dozens of control owners who weren’t GRC experts.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Playbook:</strong> We leveraged ServiceNow’s modern capabilities to build a <strong>user-centric assessment model</strong>. This involved:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Configuring Smart Assessment Templates:</strong> We created over 100 templates, one for each sub-category, pre-populating them with guidance and instructions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automating the Kickoff:</strong> We built a “one-click” function on the business entity record (e.g., “Transmission”) that automatically launched the entire assessment process, creating and assigning all necessary tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowering the Business:</strong> We created detailed training collateral and test plans to empower the business lead for the NIST program, enabling him to manage and update templates himself. This reduced long-term reliance on the IT platform team and fostered true business ownership.</p></li></ol></li></ul><h4><strong>The Challenge 3: Navigating the Unseen Strategic Blockers</strong></h4><p>During a demo, we uncovered a critical strategic misalignment. Our plan to use ServiceNow’s standard “Employee Center” portal for GRC tasks conflicted with a separate, long-term enterprise initiative to build a single, custom-branded employee portal.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> Proceeding as planned would have created a fractured user experience and technical debt. This is a classic example of a project-level decision having unforeseen enterprise-level consequences.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Playbook:</strong> This is where proactive governance and flexible planning become critical. By identifying this conflict during a demo—not after deployment—we were able to <strong>pause and pivot</strong>. We immediately flagged the issue for executive review. In parallel, we adjusted our release strategy, decoupling the NIST workstream from other dependencies. This agile decision allowed us to:</p><ol><li><p>Deliver the time-sensitive NIST compliance capability on schedule.</p></li><li><p>Provide the business the space to make a strategic decision on the portal without holding the entire program hostage.</p></li><li><p>Demonstrate a commitment to quality and enterprise alignment over rigidly adhering to a combined release plan.</p></li></ol></li></ul><h3>Key Takeaways for Program Leaders</h3><p>This program reinforced three critical lessons for leading complex transformations:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Technology is Only Half the Battle.</strong> The biggest risks are often not in the code, but in legacy system constraints and competing enterprise strategies. Your job as a leader is to find and de-risk them early.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agile Isn’t Just a Buzzword; It’s a Risk Mitigation Tool.</strong> The ability to decouple workstreams and adjust release plans based on new information is what separates successful programs from failing ones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empower Your Stakeholders.</strong> The most sustainable solutions are the ones the business can own. Investing in training and self-service capabilities pays dividends long after the project team disbands.</p></li></ol>
