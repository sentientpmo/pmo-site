href="https://open.substack.com/pub/mkaplan/p/delivering-cybersecurity-and-it-transformation?r=2hlfc9&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">Delivering High Stakes Programs in a NERC CIP Environment</a></strong>, I outlined the high accountability framework we operated in. Every project demanded extreme precision. One of the best examples of this in action was the <strong>Risk Reporting &amp; Integrations (RRI)</strong> program, a mission critical effort to automate compliance, deploy the NIST CSF 2.0 framework, and harden our GRC posture in ServiceNow.</p><p>On the surface, the mission was clear. But like any program worth doing, the real test was not in the plan; it was in navigating the turbulence. Here’s a look at three major challenges that could have derailed the project and how we steered through them.</p><h4><strong>The Mission: Untangling a Manual Mess</strong></h4><p>First, the "why." Ameren's risk and compliance processes were bogged down by manual work. Compliance actions in one system had to be manually tracked in another, a process ripe for human error and painful to audit. We needed to automate a key workflow between ServiceNow and a legacy ChangeGear system, roll out a brand new assessment process for the NIST CSF 2.0 framework, and clean up our core risk management module.</p><p>It was a three headed beast, and all three workstreams had to land in a single, coordinated production deployment.</p><h4><strong>The "How": Navigating Three Inevitable Storms</strong></h4><p>Every complex program hits roadblocks. The difference between a successful program and a failed one is the speed and decisiveness with which you handle them. Here are the three biggest we faced.</p><p><strong>Challenge #1: The API Refused to Cooperate.</strong></p><p>The cornerstone of the project was a custom API integration with ChangeGear. Early on, we hit a wall. The vendor’s API didn’t support the modern <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> authentication standard our security architecture required. This was a potential show stopper.</p><p>Instead of a prolonged back and forth, I led a rapid response effort with our architects and the vendor’s engineers. We designed a secure path forward using API keys, but I did not just approve it in a silo. We presented our solution, complete with a mandatory quarterly key rotation as a compensating control, to Ameren’s <strong>ServiceNow Governance board</strong>. They formally approved the exception, giving us the top down cover to proceed without violating security policy. When we later hit firewall blockers, we pivoted again, implementing a <strong>Mid Server</strong> architecture to bypass the issue entirely.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Do not just find a technical workaround. Own the solution by navigating the formal governance process to get it blessed. It protects the project and the business.</p><p><strong>Challenge #2: Averting a Post Launch Disaster with Strategic Governance.</strong></p><p>Partway through the build, I spotted a huge strategic risk. We were configuring the NIST framework for a small, initial set of 8 business entities. But no one could answer a critical question: <em>“Who will be responsible for defining and maintaining the other 200+ entities after we go live?”</em></p><p>The project was on track to deliver a powerful tool that would become an ungoverned, chaotic mess within six months. This is a classic project to operations gap that can render a multimillion dollar investment useless.</p><p>I immediately escalated this ambiguity to the Project Approval Committee (PAC). In our formal Definition Gate review, I framed it as an operational readiness issue. The result was a swift, decisive action from leadership.</p><ol><li><p>The formal, enterprise wide GRC Governance Framework was officially declared <strong>out of my project’s scope</strong>, averting scope creep.</p></li><li><p>A specific operational team was formally tasked with building this framework <strong>in parallel</strong> to my project.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> A Program Manager’s job is not just to deliver the "what," but to force the tough conversations about the "how," particularly how the business will sustain the value long after the project team disbands.</p><p><strong>Challenge #3: Protecting the Project from Its Own Dependencies.</strong></p><p>This program's success hinged on a small group of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who were stretched thin across multiple initiatives. The risk of delay due to a key person being unavailable for testing or a design session was massive.</p><p>This was not a risk we could simply "accept." We mitigated it aggressively from day one. I insisted on identifying and formally designating <strong>backup SMEs</strong> for every critical function. We proactively scheduled workshops weeks in advance, planned around known PTO, and maintained a clear line of sight into the resource pipeline. When we had a critical dependency on the Platform Team to install a necessary ServiceNow plugin, we tracked it not as a task, but as a high priority risk on our RAID log, providing daily visibility to leadership until it was resolved.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Hope is not a strategy. Proactive and aggressive management of human dependencies is just as important as managing the technical ones.</p><h4><strong>The Payoff: Beyond Just "On Time"</strong></h4><p>By tackling these challenges head on, we did not just stay on schedule. We delivered a solution that was not only technically sound but operationally resilient and audit ready. The ChangeGear integration went live, the NIST CSF 2.0 module was ready for its first assessments, and we had created comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for everything from API key rotation to role management.</p><p>This RRI program is a microcosm of my delivery philosophy: anticipate risks, lead decisively through ambiguity, and build for the long haul. It’s how you turn a high stakes, high complexity challenge into a lasting business capability.</p>
