badges.</p></li><li><p>People celebrating: <em>“I just got my PMP!”</em> or <em>“I just got my Scrum Master cert!”</em></p></li></ol><p>And I see 50 people liking it. “Congrats!” “Way to go!”</p><p>We need to stop with the toxic positivity. You are cheering for someone who just bought a ticket to the Titanic after it hit the iceberg.</p><p>The “White-Collar Recession” reported by LinkedIn News isn’t a temporary dip. It is a permanent structural correction. The market is ruthlessly eliminating the “Middlemen” of the corporate world.</p><p><strong>Why I Am Warning You (The Progenitor’s Guilt)</strong><br>I am not an outsider throwing rocks at the castle. I helped build the castle.</p><p>I have been building PMIS systems before the acronym existed. My first system was for the <strong>Pentagon Renovation</strong> in 1995, built from scratch in <strong>MITRE’s Lab</strong>. I worked with the pioneers of this industry—<strong>Joel Koppelman</strong> (Primavera) and <strong>Dick Ferris</strong>. Later, at <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, I was the one who pushed the first integration of MS Project data into SharePoint.</p><p>I know what is happening now because I know what we built then. We intended to build systems of <em>Control</em>. Instead, we built systems of <em>Tax</em>. We gave corporations the ability to micro-manage complexity without understanding it.</p><p>I helped build the prison. Now, I am handing you the key.</p><p>Here is the hard truth about why the profession is contracting, and why those jobs are never coming back.</p><h3><strong>1. The Credential Bubble Has Burst</strong></h3><p>For twenty years, the “Credential Industrial Complex” (PMI, etc.) committed the ultimate economic sin: <strong>They devalued their own currency.</strong></p><p>To drive revenue, they prioritized Volume over Excellence. They convinced millions of people that if they just memorized 49 processes or learned the inputs and outputs, they were “Project Managers.”<br>They flooded the market with “Paper Generals.”</p><ul><li><p><strong>Supply:</strong> Infinite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand:</strong> Shrinking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Result:</strong> Senior leaders—Architects with 20 years of experience—are now forced to compete on price with “Bootcamp Grads” because HR algorithms can’t tell the difference.</p></li></ul><p>Your certification is no longer career insurance. It is a receipt for a tax you shouldn’t be paying.</p><h3><strong>2. The Collapse of the “Agile Industrial Complex”</strong></h3><p>For the last ten years, I have watched the Agile community throw stones at Project Managers. They told us “Manager” was a dirty word. They told us that if we just bought enough sticky notes and “trusted the team,” the software would write itself.</p><p>They were arrogant. And they were wrong.</p><p>While they were mocking the PMP, they were busy building the single greatest act of bureaucratic hypocrisy in history: <strong>SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework).</strong> They took the worst parts of the “Admin Tax” and industrialized it.</p><p><strong>Now, the market is handing them their credentials to eat.</strong><br>Agile was invented to solve <em>Human Latency</em> (people are slow). In 2026, AI writes and tests code instantly. AI removes the latency.<br>If you are still getting paid $140k to facilitate a “Daily Standup” or ask “What did you do yesterday?”, you aren’t managing flow; you are enforcing a ritual.</p><p>The “Ceremony Masters” are being evicted. The ranks are closing. And frankly, it is long overdue.</p><h3><strong>3. The “Jig Is Up” on the Admin Tax</strong></h3><p>For years, I managed a <strong>$25M NERC CIP portfolio</strong>—one of the most regulated environments on earth.<br>By “Standard” metrics, that role requires 60 hours a week of grinding.<br><strong>I did it in 20.</strong></p><p>I didn’t cheat. I delivered Zero Audit Findings.<br>I simply refused to pay the “Admin Tax.” I automated the governance. I built a machine that did the chasing, the reporting, and the logging for me.</p><p>Corporations are realizing they have been paying full-time salaries for roles that are 80% administrative waste.</p><ul><li><p>If your value is “updating the file,” you are gone.</p></li><li><p>If your value is “facilitating the meeting,” you are gone.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>From Physics to Fluff (and Back Again)</strong></h3><p>I started my career as a Master Scheduler for the <strong>Pentagon Renovation</strong>.<br>In that world, Governance was Physics. If the schedule was wrong, the blast-resistant concrete didn’t get poured. You couldn’t “status report” your way out of a missing wall.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, our industry lost that rigor. We replaced “Physics” with “Process.” We started valuing the <em>artifact</em> (the chart) over the <em>asset</em> (the outcome).</p><p>The current contraction is painful, but necessary. It is the return of Physics.</p><p><strong>The Choice</strong><br>The “Sea of Green Badges” isn’t going away until we admit the truth: <strong>The era of the Administrator is over.</strong></p><p>But the era of the <strong>Architect</strong> is just beginning.<br>The market is starving for leaders who know how to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Diagnose</strong> complex systems (Forensic Governance).</p></li><li><p><strong>Architect</strong> automated workflows (The Zero-Tech Stack).</p></li><li><p><strong>Drive</strong> strategic pivots based on data (The Gold Line).</p></li></ol><p>It is time to hit the “Escape Button” on the old way.<br>Stop banking on the badge. Start building the machine.</p><p><strong>[<a href="https://a.co/d/bSgYdXM">Link to Book</a>]</strong></p>
