mission-critical cybersecurity turnarounds, I’ve come to realize a fundamental truth about getting things done in a complex organization.</p><p>Your success as a leader has almost nothing to do with your project plan.</p><p>The Gantt chart, the budget spreadsheet, the status report—these are just artifacts. They are the language of administration, not the engine of delivery. The real work, the work that separates the leaders who deliver from the managers who just report, happens in a completely different domain. It’s the work of mastering the three true currencies of leadership.</p><p><strong>Currency #1: Competence (The Price of Admission)</strong></p><p>This is the baseline. You have to know your craft. You must be an expert in process, governance, risk management, and the brutal, meticulous art of execution. It’s your ability to walk into a chaotic, failing project and, within days, create a framework for control—a RAID log, a recovery plan, a clear path forward.</p><p>Competence is what gets you into the room. It’s what makes a Portfolio Manager trust you with his most difficult assignments. It’s your reputation, earned in the fire of past deliveries. It is the non-negotiable price of admission to any high-stakes game.</p><p>But it is not enough.</p><p><strong>Currency #2: Credibility (The Power to Influence)</strong></p><p>In any large organization, you will eventually hit a brick wall. It might be a non-negotiable mandate from a “Gatekeeper,” a political battle with a rival department, or a project-killing technical blocker. In these moments, your authority as a Project Manager is worthless. Your only tool is your credibility.</p><p>Credibility is the trust you have earned with stakeholders. It’s what allows you to walk into a tense meeting with the Platform Team and have them listen when you say, “I understand your security standard, but our investigation has revealed a technical impossibility. Let’s find another way.”</p><p>It’s what allows you to go to a high-stakes sponsor and say, “The timeline is at risk, and here is the data to prove it. We need to make a decision.”</p><p>You don’t build credibility by being agreeable. You build it by being honest, by using data to frame reality, and by demonstrating that your loyalty is to the outcome, not to any one person’s agenda. It is the currency that allows you to negotiate, to pivot, and to lead without formal authority.</p><p><strong>Currency #3: Courage (The Will to Act)</strong></p><p>This is the final, and most important, currency. It’s the one that can’t be taught in any certification course.</p><p>Courage is the willingness to step into the mess. It’s taking on the failing project when no one else would. It’s accepting the assignment, knowing you were walking into a political minefield.</p><p>Courage is the willingness to have the hard conversations. It’s telling a powerful stakeholder their mandate is impossible. It’s forcing a decision on risk acceptance for having no test environment.</p><p>And most of all, courage is the willingness to absorb the pressure. It’s acting as the shield for your team, standing in the gap between the chaos from above and the need for stability on the ground. It’s the quiet resilience to keep pushing forward, inch by painful inch, when every rational indicator says the project should fail.</p><p><strong>The Lesson from the Trenches</strong></p><p>After many years, here is what I know to be true. Project plans will shatter. Methodologies like Prosci and Agile are just tools, and they are useless in the hands of a leader who hasn’t mastered the real currencies of the trade.</p><p>Don’t focus on becoming a better administrator of tasks. Focus on becoming a leader who builds <strong>competence</strong> through practice, earns <strong>credibility</strong> through integrity, and demonstrates the <strong>courage</strong> to lead when it matters most.</p><p>Because when the plan is gone, the budget is blown, and the walls are closing in, those three currencies are the only things that will get you and your team to the other side.</p>
