The mission: a massive expansion to double the capacity for their critical <strong>thinkorswim</strong> trading operation.</p><p>When I arrived, I realized the problem was far deeper than a schedule slip. The building architect had a beautiful design for the new, adjacent space. But it was a ghost town. Not only was there no technology design, but the chaos was absolute.</p><p>The puzzle I was handed had a dizzying number of missing pieces:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The People Puzzle:</strong> No one had decided where the hundreds of traders and support staff were going to sit in the new, multi-floor layout.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Technology Puzzle:</strong> No one had defined <em>what technology</em> those people would use. Was it a simple refresh of existing workstations, or was this the moment to design the next-generation trading desk?</p></li><li><p><strong>The Media Puzzle:</strong> And then there was the broadcast studio. TD Ameritrade’s Chicago office wasn’t just a trading floor; it was a media hub. Their broadcast-quality cameras roamed the floor for live interviews, adding a layer of A/V, lighting, and network complexity that touched everything.</p></li></ul><p>This wasn’t a simple construction project. This was <strong>open-heart surgery on a live trading operation, while simultaneously building a television studio inside the operating room.</strong> And we had to do it all without disrupting the existing, revenue-generating business for a single minute.</p><p>I knew a construction bid based on this level of ambiguity would be a multi-million dollar catastrophe of change orders and delays.</p><p>I immediately convened the leadership team—from facility engineering in Nebraska to the business and tech leaders on the ground in Chicago.</p><p>My message was direct:</p><p><strong>“We have to stop talking about the building and start talking about the business inside it. Before we can specify a single network cable, we must first decide where every person will sit, what technology they will use, and how our broadcast operations will function in the new space. The human and business decisions are the foundation for the entire technical blueprint.”</strong></p><p>That conversation forced the series of challenging, but essential, decisions that had been deferred for months. My mission was no longer just to “get the project back on track.” It was to be the <strong>master orchestrator of this entire human, technical, and media ecosystem.</strong></p><p>There was no formal PMO process to follow. We had to create it.</p><ul><li><p>I led the difficult, political conversations to finalize the seating chart.</p></li><li><p>We used that people-plan to define the requirements for the next-generation trading desk.</p></li><li><p>We brought in specialist A/V and low-voltage engineers to design the broadcast-ready infrastructure.</p></li><li><p>And we used all of that to architect a total redesign of the data center and network to support this new, high-density, media-rich environment.</p></li></ul><p>It was an immense number of puzzle pieces, and for me, it was incredibly fun.</p><p>I led an 18-member team to forge all of this chaos into a single, coherent technology engineering package—the definitive blueprint for the entire operation.</p><p><strong>The Result: A Successful Transplant</strong></p><p>By forcing the hard conversations and solving the human puzzle first, we de-risked the entire engagement. We mitigated over $500,000 in foreseeable costs and delivered the complete, build-ready design package 45 days ahead of the revised schedule.</p><p>It’s a powerful lesson in leadership. When faced with overwhelming complexity, the leader’s job isn’t just to manage the pieces. It’s to have the foresight to see how they all connect and the passion to love the challenge of putting them all together.</p>
