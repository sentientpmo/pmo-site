I tore down hangars, dug up runways, and entombed a toxic landfill. Here’s how we did it.</p><p>I still remember some of those mornings. Before the first roar of an excavator shattered the silence, I’d stand by our job trailer and look out across the old base. It was quiet. Overgrown fields, deer running wild through the mist, and the early morning dew settling on everything. It was a peaceful, beautiful wilderness, but a deceptive one. Because beneath that quiet surface lay our mission: to erase a toxic past and build a clean future.</p><p>For a few years in the mid-90s, I was the master of the controlled chaos that followed that sunrise. My official title was Quality Control Supervisory Engineer, but a better description would be “master of controlled chaos.” I managed the entire construction lifecycle for the base’s environmental cleanup. It was my job to oversee the demolition of a half-century of military history and remediate the contamination it left behind.</p><p>And honestly? It was a blast.</p><p>My scope was huge, and every day brought a new, fascinating challenge. One week, I’d be overseeing the structural demolition of colossal air hangars... the next, digging up miles of the old flight line. We took down old motor pool buildings and hunted for leaky underground fuel tanks.</p><p>But the real grit of the job was in how we chased the contamination. It wasn’t just digging; it was a highly scientific treasure hunt for trouble, and I was at the center of it.</p><p>My first step on any contaminated site was to lay out a precise excavation grid. This was our map. As the excavators scraped away the earth, layer by layer, my real work began. I personally packed hundreds of soil samples, each one meticulously labeled and sealed. I managed the strict chain-of-custody paperwork for every sample we sent to the lab—a critical step to ensure our data was legally defensible. If that chain was broken, the sample was worthless.</p><p>When the lab reports came back, I was the one analyzing them. The data would paint a picture of the contamination plume, and I would use it to direct the crews, telling them, “Dig another two feet here,” or, “This section is clean, we can move on.” It was a constant, relentless cycle: dig, sample, analyze, repeat.</p><p>And we did all of this under a constant watch for safety. I set up the air monitoring stations across the site and worked side-by-side with industrial hygienists. We were constantly checking for airborne contaminants to ensure the safety of my crew and the surrounding environment. It was my responsibility to make sure the hazards we were digging up didn’t get into the air we were breathing.</p><h3>We Hit Pay Dirt</h3><p>Now, all this meticulous, scientific work—the grids, the samples, the lab reports—had another dimension: the business side. I wrote the test plans that guided this process, and as the contractor, our financial success was directly tied to the scale of the problem we were solving.</p><p>And the problem was massive.</p><p>If I recall correctly, the project started with a base contract in the $5 to $6 million range. It was a long time ago, but I remember that number felt huge at the time. But the real money, the real growth, was in the unknowns.</p><p>Every time we dug up a new hotspot, it meant more work. But it also meant more revenue. A key part of our operation was that we also owned the laboratory that processed every single soil sample. Running hundreds, even thousands, of lab samples is expensive, and every sample I carefully packed and sent off represented a cost to the project... and revenue for our company.</p><p>There was so much contaminated dirt that a powerful feedback loop was created. The more contamination we found, the more we had to dig to find its boundaries. Every new foot of digging required new samples to prove it was clean.</p><p>You could say we hit pay dirt.</p><p>Our mandate from the Army Corps of Engineers was clear: keep digging and keep testing until the soil met their stringent cleanup levels. It was a cycle that continued until the client gave the final word: “Stop.” By the time all was said and done, I believe the final project value had swelled to around $10 million.</p><p>So much of that project comes back to that simple, rhythmic reality: Digging dirt. Sampling dirt. Piling dirt. Moving dirt. :-)</p><p>In today’s money, we essentially turned a $12 million job into a $20+ million operation, one change order at a time. And in all honesty, that project spun off so much cash from that growth, the owners bought two mansions right at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge in the Marina District. It was that kind of project.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png" width="1092" height="865" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:865,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1434946,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mkaplan.substack.com/i/176280877?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iDs3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d628a5-61ae-4b98-b9ba-df24e59e9fbf_1092x865.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>An Engineer’s “What If”</h3><p>I need to be clear about my role. I wasn’t the designer, and I wasn’t the owner (the Army Corps of Engineers). I was the guy on the ground hired to execute their plan to the highest possible standard. The plan we had was sound, and it was the accepted, cost-effective approach at the time: consolidate the worst of the contaminated soil into Landfill 26 and cap it.</p><p>From a project owner’s standpoint, dealing with a budget and a timeline, it made practical sense. But as the engineer managing the logistics of every single truckload of that contaminated dirt, I couldn’t help but think about it differently.</p><p>And there was a lot of dirt.</p><p>We’re not talking about a few dump trucks. We’re talking about a mountain of soil tainted with everything from petroleum to solvents. Every time we dug up a hot spot or an old leaky tank, that mountain grew. The plan was to move that mountain from one part of the base to another and bury it.</p><p>If I’d been in the designer’s chair, I would have championed a different approach. Instead of just moving the problem, I would have advocated for treating it on-site.</p><p>This would have meant setting up a soil processing facility right there on the base. We could have used technologies like bioremediation, where you essentially use microorganisms to “eat” the petroleum contaminants over time. Or we could have built a soil washing plant to physically separate the clean soil from the toxic sludge.</p><p>Now, this approach would have had its own challenges—a longer timeline, a more complex setup, and likely a higher upfront cost. Those are tough pills for any project owner to swallow.</p><p>But the benefits would have been immense. We could have dramatically reduced the sheer volume of material that needed to be entombed in the landfill. We would have been left with a much smaller, more manageable “containment cell” and a vast amount of clean, reusable soil. It’s the difference between putting a problem in a box forever and actually solving a huge part of it permanently.</p><p>Ultimately, we executed the approved plan flawlessly. But for an engineer on the ground, watching that mountain of dirt get moved from one hole to another, you always have that “what if.” There’s a certain elegance to solving a problem at its root, not just containing it. It’s the kind of challenge that gets an engineer’s mind working, even long after the job is done.</p><h3>The Crown Jewel</h3><p>But of all those projects, one stood out as the ultimate challenge, the crown jewel of the entire operation: <strong>Landfill 26.</strong></p><p>This wasn’t just another contaminated site; it was the place where everything ended up. It was the final boss of the cleanup, a 26-acre toxic cocktail of everything from benzene and DDT to heavy metals and PCBs. Our job was to entomb it. Permanently. As the supervisor and project controls manager for this specific task, the buck stopped with me. I inspected every seam on the massive plastic liners, signed off on every layer of clay, and submitted the mountain of paperwork to the Army Corps of Engineers that proved the job was done right.</p><p>But the real excitement for me was building the landfill’s life support system: a full-scale, industrial water treatment plant. This was the active, beating heart of the containment. Walking into that building was like stepping into the engine room of a ship. We installed a towering Air Stripper to pull carcinogens out of the water, its massive blower roaring like the building was breathing. We installed enormous Granular Activated Carbon vessels—the kidneys of the system—to filter out the toughest pesticides.</p><p>The most exciting day of the project was when we commissioned that plant. After months of construction, we started flipping the switches. You hear the pumps kick on with a thud, see the water start to flow, and feel the hum of the machinery in the floor. We took a sample of the foul, dark liquid coming in from the landfill, and then a sample of the treated water coming out the other end.</p><p>Seeing that clean water emerge for the first time was incredible. It was the culmination of all the planning, the engineering, the sweat. But that moment of success didn’t come easy. Commissioning required us to babysit the system around the clock for 48 straight hours, monitoring every pump, valve, and sensor. It was exhausting. You’d catch a few minutes of sleep in a truck and get right back to it. But it was the only way to be certain our creation was ready to stand guard for the next hundred years. Seeing that clean water emerge after that marathon effort wasn’t just a success; it was a profound relief.</p><p>My job wasn’t over when the plant was running. We had to ensure it would keep running for the next thirty years. So, my final act on that project was to create its future. I personally set up the entire Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) system from scratch. We created the plant’s complete “run book”—its bible. We logged everything: every part, every motor, every pump, and every filter. I mapped out the entire preventative maintenance schedule, down to the exact date to change the oil in a specific piece of equipment. We turned over a system so detailed that anyone could step in and understand how to keep the guardian running.</p><h3>A Career-Defining Project</h3><p>So when I see that park today, I don’t just see a field. I see the ghosts of hangars we brought down. I see the footprint of runways we tore up. And I know that just beneath the surface is a feat of engineering that I helped build—a silent guardian that will keep that community safe for generations.</p><p>And to be honest, I was just a couple of years out of the UF Building Construction school when this all happened. It was my second job. I had left a big firm, Parsons, to move to San Francisco to be near family, and this massive project practically fell into my lap. My brother’s girlfriend was close friends with the owner of the company that won the contract, and suddenly I had my shot.</p><p>It was a classic case of luck meeting preparation. I was young, but I had the schooling. And I performed flawlessly.</p><p>The business people behind that deal were brilliant, and they gave me the freedom to basically run the show. For me, it remains one of the most rewarding projects of my career.</p><p>It’s an amazing feeling to witness what we accomplished with that property, to see that thriving community, and be able to say, “I made that happen. That was my project.”</p><p>We didn’t just build a park; we erased a messy past to make way for a clean future.</p>
